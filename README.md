# UnityUtils
Collection of miscellaneous scripts that I use often in my Unity projects. To be updated frequently as I come across stuff I may need.

# Requirements
This library needs the following plugins to work correctly:

- Netcode for GameObjects
- Text Mesh Pro
- Addressables

There are several optional components that are enabled with a Scripting Define Symbol:

- Hurricane VR Integration -> HVR_OCULUS (automatically added on install)
- DoTween -> DOTWEEN (automatically added on install)
- Dissonance -> DISSONANCE (must be added manually)
- Rage Against The Pixel's OpenAI Wrapper -> OPENAI (must be added manually)
